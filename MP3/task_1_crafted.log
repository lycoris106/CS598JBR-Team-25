### Instruction:
Can you translate the following Python code into Java?
The new Java code must be enclosed between [Java Start] and [Java End]

### Requirements
- Output ONLY Java code, no explanations.
- Do NOT use Markdown code fences (no ```java, no ```).
- Do NOT define any class named Main.
- Define a class Solution and put all translated methods inside it.
- Use the following Java method declaration exactly (do NOT change parameter types, modifiers, or return type):
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isSorted(List<Integer> lst) {

- Preserve the original Python logic exactly; do NOT rewrite or simplify the algorithm.
- Make sure all opened braces { and } and parentheses () are closed.
- Output a full, compilable Java class Solution and do NOT output anything after [Java End].

- The final output MUST be exactly in this format:
